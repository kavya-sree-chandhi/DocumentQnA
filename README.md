# PDF Q&A Chatbot ü§ñ

## üìñ Introduction

**PDF Q&A Chatbot** is an AI-powered web application that allows you to upload any text-based PDF and ask natural-language questions about its content.  
It combines [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) for the user interface, [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/) for workflow orchestration, [ChromaDB](https://www.trychroma.com/) for semantic retrieval, [HuggingFace Embeddings](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2) for semantic understanding, and [Groq Llama3-70B](https://groq.com/) as the large language model that generates answers.  
This tool is perfect for extracting insights from research papers, reports, books, or any other PDF.

## üöÄ How to Run (Setup Process)

1. **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/kavya-sree-chandhi/DocumentQnA]
    cd yourrepo
    ```

2. **Create and activate a Python virtual environment** (recommended)
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows:
    venv\Scripts\activate
    # On Mac/Linux:
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3. **Install dependencies**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    <details>
    <summary>Sample <code>requirements.txt</code></summary>

    ```
    streamlit
    langchain
    langchain-community
    langchain-groq
    chromadb
    huggingface-hub
    ```
    </details>

4. **Set your Groq API key**
    - [Sign up for Groq](https://console.groq.com/keys) and copy your API key.
    - For demos, you may hardcode it, but for best practice, create a `.env` file:
        ```
        GROQ_API_KEY=your_actual_groq_api_key
        ```
      And update your code to use `os.getenv("GROQ_API_KEY")`.

5. **Run the app**
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```
    - Open [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501) in your browser.
    - Upload a PDF and start chatting!

## üöÄ How it Works

1. **Starting the Streamlit App**
First, we need to start the Streamlit application, as shown:

3. **Initial App State (Before PDF Upload)**
Initially, the app shows an upload widget prompting you to upload a PDF file. The Q&A feature is disabled until a PDF is provided.

4. **PDF Uploaded, Q&A in Action**
After uploading a PDF, the app processes it and displays a green success message. You can now ask questions about the PDF‚Äôs content. Example shown: Asking, ‚Äúwhat is the pdf about?‚Äù
